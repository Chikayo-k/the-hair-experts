The Hair Experts is the fifth project in the Code Institute Diploma in Full Stack Software Development.
It is a B2C ( Business to Consumer) full stack E-commerce website that offers a range of hair care products and treatments. Userâ€™s can create accounts, browse through a selected range of hair care products and items, add them to their basket and purchase them. Users also have the ability to create wishlists and leave comments on products. 

The project was developed using Django, Python, JavaScript, HTML5, CSS and a Postgres relational database to store the site's data. Stripe was used as the payment system

The project was developed using Agile methodologies. This was tracked using Githubs built in boards so I could create Sprints to track the Epics and User Stories.
